## Bite-Sized ML Explorations

This repository is a collection of small, self-contained machine learning notebooks I wrote to understand and reinforce *how and why models fail* as much as how they’re built.

Each notebook tackles a single concept (e.g. concept drift, evaluation pitfalls, misleading metrics) using simple, synthetic examples and lightweight Python code. The goal is clarity over completeness, "done" over "perfect": intentionally bite-sized experiments, explanations, and just enough theory to make the behavior make sense.
